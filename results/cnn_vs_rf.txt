Neural Network (MLP) vs Random Forest Comparison
==================================================

Setup:
  RF: 69 hand-crafted features (PSD + statistical)
  MLP: Raw flattened EEG (3000 inputs), 2 hidden layers (128, 64)
  Both: Cross-subject split, same train/test subjects

Stage 1 (Rest vs Active):
  RF:  0.794
  MLP: 0.791

Stage 2 (Direction, 4-class):
  RF:  0.279
  MLP: 0.243

Latency (per window, including feature extraction for RF):
  RF:  13.3ms avg, 20.8ms p95
  MLP: 0.3ms avg, 0.5ms p95

Conclusion:
  RF with hand-crafted features matches or beats the MLP
  on raw EEG, validating our feature engineering approach.
  MLP is 48.7x faster at inference.
  For real-time BCI at >10 Hz, both meet the <100ms target.
