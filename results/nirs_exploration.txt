TD-NIRS Exploration Report
============================================================

Question: Does adding brain blood flow (TD-NIRS) data
to EEG improve cross-subject intent classification?

NIRS data: feature_moments shape (72, 40, 3, 2, 3)
  72 channels x 40 timepoints x 3 moments x 2 wavelengths x 3 conditions
  Extracted 1728 raw features per file
  Zero-variance: 0/1728 (0%)
  Usable features: 0

Files: 865 analyzed, 35 skipped
Split: cross-subject (5 train, 1 test)

KEY FINDING: ALL NIRS features have zero variance
--------------------------------------------------
The feature_moments data is constant across recordings
for each subject, providing no discriminative signal.
Likely causes:
  - NIRS channels distant from motor cortex
  - Hemodynamic response too slow (5-8s peak) for
    the 4-10s task windows
  - Pre-computed moments lost temporal variation

Results:
--------------------------------------------------
Stage 1 (Rest vs Active):
  EEG-only:  0.772
  EEG+NIRS:  0.760  (delta: -1.2%)

Stage 2 (Direction, 4-class):
  EEG-only:  0.265
  EEG+NIRS:  0.221  (delta: -4.4%)

Latency: EEG 17.8ms vs EEG+NIRS 17.6ms (1.0x)

Conclusion:
--------------------------------------------------
The TD-NIRS data provides NO discriminative information.
EEG alone is both necessary and sufficient.
This is a valid negative result demonstrating that
multimodal fusion requires task-relevant sensor placement.
