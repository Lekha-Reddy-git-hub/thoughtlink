Latency-Accuracy Tradeoff: LR vs SVM vs RF vs MLP
============================================================

Model       Stage 1    Stage 2      Latency
------------------------------------------
LR            79.4%      27.4%       11.7ms
SVM           79.4%      28.1%       11.7ms
RF            79.4%      27.9%       24.7ms
MLP           79.1%      24.3%        0.3ms

Notes:
  - LR, SVM, RF use 69 hand-crafted features (PSD + statistical)
  - MLP uses raw flattened EEG (3000 inputs)
  - Latency includes feature extraction time for LR/SVM/RF
  - All evaluations use cross-subject leave-one-out splits
  - All models are well under the 100ms real-time threshold

Best Stage 1: RF (79.4%)
Best Stage 2: SVM (28.1%)
Fastest: MLP (0.3ms)
